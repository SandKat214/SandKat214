Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my learning journey across various technologies and frameworks. Iâ€™m particularly passionate about full stack development, with a focus on React for frontend design and MySQL for backend solutions. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for new and reliable learning resources outside of the classroom to further expand my skills and knowledge.
